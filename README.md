# RBR-CTD-Processing
To process raw RBR CTD data in Python. The main reference for this routine is Halverson et al. (2017). 

RBR_Processing.py is deprecated and has been replaced by RBR_CTD_IOS.py.

RBR_CTD_IOS.py contains the following processing steps, which are accompanied by before/after plots.

- Export raw data from .rsk or .xlsx to .csv files

- Create metadata dictionary

- Prepare CTD_DATA.csv with 6 line headers for IOSShell

- Plot and check profile locations

- Plot first-order pressure differences to check need for zero-order hold

- (If needed) Correct for zero-order holds by replacing holds with NaNs

- (If needed) CALIB: Pressure/Depth correction if there are negative pressure values with corresponding conductivity values above about 30 mS/cm

- CLIP: Remove measurements near sea surface and bottom

- FILTER: Apply a low pass filter to pressure, temperature, conductivity, and fluorescence (if available)

- SHIFT: Shift conductivity and recalculate salinity

- SHIFT: Shift oxygen saturation

- DERIVE: Derive oxygen concentration in mL/L and umol/kg from oxygen saturation following SCOR WG 142

- DELETE: Remove pressure reversals

- BINAVE: Average the data into 1-dbar bins

- EDIT: Apply final editing, including converting conductivity units from mS/cm to S/m

- Prepare .ctd files following the IOS Header file ASCII format

##### Requirements
- Python >= 3.8
- pyrsktools >= 1.1.1
- Hakai ocean-data-parser package for converting oxygen saturation: https://github.com/HakaiInstitute/ocean-data-parser
